Anyday is a new way to pay. An interest-free financing solution with no fees or interest for your customers.

== Description ==

Anyday is a fair and transparent installment payment method you can add to your online store. It is interest-free and without any unexpected expenses and unpleasant surprises.

The plugin allows your customers to split their payments into 4 equal installments. The first installment is always paid at checkout and the remaining installments are paid on the last banking day of the following three months.

Anyday is always completely free of interest and your customers pay no additional fees as long as their installments are paid on time. In short: Anyday is both fair and transparent.

To sign up for Anyday customers go through a quick but thorough credit evaluation and upon being accepted they will be granted credit. The credit with Anyday is revolving, which allows customers to utilize their available credit multiple times after paying off installments. Regardless of how many times a customer chooses to utilize their credit the terms remain the same - no fees, no interest.

When you sign an agreement and implement Anyday in your online store you will be added to Anydayâ€™s shop collection. Furthermore, Anyday will upon request provide you with marketing material, feature you in their consumer newsletters, and link to your store via social media. All are completely free of charge.

Anyday assumes the credit risk when a customer chooses to pay with Anyday so you can focus on what you do best - running your business. Orders will be paid out to you in full on a weekly basis.

It is in everyoneâ€™s best interest that customers pay installments on time. Therefore, Anyday makes sure to inform customers of when they need to pay and how much they need to pay.

Anyday is fully compliant with Danish legislation.
